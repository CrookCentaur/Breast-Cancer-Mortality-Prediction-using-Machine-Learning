This project demonstrates Breast Cancer mortality prediction using machine learning algorithms in a python-based environment using real-life data. Two main goals are achieved by this project:

1️⃣To accurately predict (based on certain parameters) whether a patient will or will not develop breast cancer (using classification models)

2️⃣ If the patient has cancer, to then predict the survival rate of the patient in the number of months (using regression models)

The models are then further optimized to improve accuracy and F1 Score using methods like GridSearch and Hyperparameter tuning
